![LED Mini Board](photos/green_badge.jpg)

## Hardware

The types supported by this project have an array of

- 44 x 11 LEDs or
- 48 x 12 LEDs.

The manufacturer is probably https://lesun-led.en.alibaba.com/

In both configurations, the badge identifies itself on the USB as

    idVendor=0416, idProduct=5020
    Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
    LSicroelectronics LS32 Custm HID

## Warning

There are many different versions of LED Badges on the market.
This one uses an USB-HID interface, while others use USB-Serial (see references below).

#### Examples:

Sudo may or may not be needed for accessing the USB device, depending on your system.

    sudo python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py "Hello World!"

loads the text 'Hello World!' as the first message, and scrolls it from right to left (default scroll mode=0) and speed 4 (default). After an upload the device shows the first message once and returns to the charging screen if still connected to USB. Either pull the plug or press the small button next to the USB connector.

    sudo python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py -m 6 -s 8 "Hello" "World!"

loads the text 'Hello' as message one and 'World!' as message two. Compare the difference in quoting to the previous example. Up to 8 messages can be uploaded. This example uses mode 6, which drops the words with a nice little animation vertically into the display area. Speed is set to maximum here, for smoothness.

Per default you will only see 'Hello'.  To see all messages, press the small button next to the USB connector multiple times, until you briefly see 'M1-8'. Now the display loops through all uploaded messages.

    sudo python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py -m 5 :gfx/fablabnbg_logo_44x11.png:

loads a fullscreen still image. Avoid whitespace between colons and name. If you receive a message `ImportError: cannot import name '_imaging'`, then try to update the corresponding package: `sudo pip install -U Pillow`

    sudo python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py "I:HEART2:my:gfx/fablab_logo_16x11.png:fablab:1:"

uses one builtin and one loaded image. The heart is builtin, and the fablab-logo is loaded from file. The fablab logo is used twice, once before the word 'fablab' and again behind through the reference ':1:' (which references the first loaded image).

    sudo python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py -s7 -m0,1 :bicycle: :bicycle_r:

shows a bicycle crossing the display in left-to-right and right-to-left (as a second message). If you select the 'M1-8' mode, the bike permanently runs back and forth the display. You may add a short message to one or both, to make it appear the bike is pulling the text around.

![LED Mini Board](photos/bicycle.gif)

    sudo python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py -b0,1 -s1 -m5 "  :heart2:    :HEART2:" "  :HEART2:"

shows a simple animation of a slowly beating heart on the first message, and a blinking heart on the second message.

    python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py --list-names

prints the list of builtin icon names, including :happy: :happy2: :heart: :HEART: :heart2: :HEART2: :fablab: :bicycle: :bicycle_r: :owncloud: ::

    python3 ./led-badge-11x44.py --help

prints some condensed help:
